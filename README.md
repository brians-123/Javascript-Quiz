# Javascript Quiz

```
Homework for week 4 of the UW coding bootcamp. Hosted on Github: https://brians-123.github.io/Web-API-HW/
```

## Description

```
This project displays javascript related questions and multiple choice answers. Throughout the process, the user will have 60 seconds to complete the quiz once they begin.

As the user selects each choice, they'll recieve feedback as to whether the answer is right or wrong below the next question. Five seconds will be deducted from their overall time if they answer a question incorrectly.

Once they start the quiz, the top right will display the time counting down (NOT FINISHED - and the left will have an option to view highscores). The timer will stop once they answer the last question and the view high score and timer will disappear when they're on the high scores page.

If they finish all the questions or they run out of time, they will be presented with the submit your score screen. Once submitted their initials and score will be displayed amongst the other high scores, sorted in descending order. (NOT FINISHED! - They will then be able to go back to the beginning of the quiz or clear all scores.)

The areas this highlights are:
1. dynamically creating, hiding, or adding html elements with javascript.
2. setting and stopping a time function with setInterval
3. local storage

The project will leverage html, css, and javascript.
